## Feedback Description
We took the advice from Kandarp to take features that solved ideas from other storyboards to make the solution for the bike path idea we liked best more interesting. Our classmates helped us decide that the bike path storyboard encompassed the most unique concept and took their advice of expanding the user base by making it about any type of path instead of just bike paths. From there we decided the user should be able to a selected path on a map to have the app generate a preview animation. We thought it would be useful for many things, like showing off a cool area you visited, or giving directions for hard to reach destinations.
