## MILESTONE 5 Write Up

What we have working so far is a MVP for the route preview feature. What the app can
do is given a starting and ending location, give a preview video of what the route would look like.
Here's a breakdown of the work

### Anish:
Anish handled the map feature of the app, and is currently working on event handlers
for the map.

### Ashkon:
Ashkon worked on developing an algorithm for getting the direction of the camera along
the route.

### Joseph:
Joseph worked on setting up the backend and researching the StreetView API

### Nic:
Nic worked on setting up ReactJS on the front end and building the video player
for the route.
