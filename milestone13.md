## MILESTONE 11 Write Up

In the last week we did work on redesigning the UI of the pages to make them look more pleasing and more easy for users to play the video with playback features.
The landing page has a new look and we starting working on autocompletion for inputting routes.

### Anish:
Anish worked on the UI of the page that displays top routes. Box shadow effects and made the add route button have a sleek design.

### Ashkon:
Ashkon added functionality for controlling route playback. He also looked into yelp api to display nearby points of interest upon pausing, but ran into issues in attempting to integrate it in our app environment.

### Joseph:
Joseph worked with Anish UI design to come up with a good looking UI for the route viewing page.

### Nic:
Nic worked on autocomplete functionality for inputting source and destinations. He also started looking into different types of routes in addition to driving, such as bike routes.
