Our application features the ability to add POIs to your route. You can select how far off your route you'd be willing to travel and what kind of POIs you would like to see. From here when you visualize the route it will display how far away they are and give you the ability to quickly add them in to your turn by turn navigation.

Our Route Preview is a feed of routes that other users have posted and rated. This feed allows the current users to look at preexisting routes that other people have taken or looked at and cross reference them with their ratings, which thus helps the user pick a route that is best for them. 

## Nic's Prototype
Our Top Routes view shows the highest routes routes by users near you. Clicking on the video player icon will play the video of the route in a modal window. Users can look at the video, view the ratings, and save the route if they like it
