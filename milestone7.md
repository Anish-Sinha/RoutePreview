## MILESTONE 6 Write Up

In the last week we have been doing research and some implementation. 
Our biggest new feature is that we have it so there is a map that side by side shows you where you are on the route along the way. We have also implemented a Facebook login system for a future user system.

### Anish:
Anish did research on click listeners for google maps. He is attempting to see if its possible to create a polyline for the google maps API by drawing directly on the map.

### Ashkon:
Ashkon did research on the Yelp API to see how it works/If it can be used for points on interest along the route.

### Joseph:
Joseph worked on having the Google Map display where along the route is currently be displayed. It is identified by "You are here" on the map.

### Nic:
Nic worked on implementing a MYSQL database and set up a facebook login.
