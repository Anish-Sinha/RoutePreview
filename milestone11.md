## MILESTONE 11 Write Up

In the last week we did work on redesigning a few of our pages to make them more user friendly.
Our biggest change was altering the front end for the page with the route preview to make it less cluttered and use space more efficiently.
We also added a feature for users to save their own routes for future use. 

### Anish:
Anish did a redesign on the page for which displays the information for the route that you are taking,. 

### Ashkon:
Ashkon did work on displaying turn by turn directions on the route preview page and is working on implementing POI's as a surrounding feature to the core map fucntionality when route is paused.

### Joseph:
Joseph did research on react and google maps intereaction to figure out how to add more functionality to the map component


### Nic:
Nic added the saved routes feature which allows you to save a route for your own account.
