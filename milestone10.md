#MILESTONE 10

What are you trying to do?
Routep.review is a tool to explore new paths. With our app, anyone can create a short video that quickly previews any route from point A to point B. This video provides a first person view of how it would look to drive the exact route. Routep.review also serves as a discovery system, providing information about local attractions at any point along the route. Furthermore, anyone can view the popular routes that other users have been previewing using our app.

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently the only way to preview a route is to go onto Google Maps and step through each panoramic Street View image along your route. Still, this time consuming process only works when the user knows exactly which directions to take at which points.

Whats new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Our approach allows users to automate this process, only requiring a starting and ending location, and provides them with a smooth, continuous video within a matter of seconds. This way, users can spend less time exploring a specific route, and more time choosing the best route. At the end of the day, this speeds up the process enormously, and provides a service that does exist currently.

Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
We hope to make the process of exploring a new area easier. With this app, anyone can go to a new location with more confidence, since they will be familiar with the exact route they have to take. Hopefully, this encourages more people to explore and shake up their status quo.
