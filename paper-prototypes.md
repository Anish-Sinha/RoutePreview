# Paper Prototypes

## Ashkon's Prototype

My paper prototype is showing the interactions that occur when you are in a visualization of your route. In the bottom right corner you have a smaller view of the map. In this smaller view it shows you your current location along the route. As you move alone this will move showing you have moved farther. The total progress is also in the bottom of the left. If you drag the point in the bottom left it will serve as a scrobbler to jump to a certain position.

The next interaction is showing Points of interests along the way on the route. You can choose these when you are creating your route. They will popup for example when a food location is showing up on the screen. There will also be a window on the right side which shows upcoming/past POIs on the route. This way you can easily find food along the way instead of having to keep checking addresses.

## Joseph's Prototype

The user inputs a source and target destination and sees a first person visualization of the path. The app recommends multiple paths and the path that is selected is highlighted. When the play button is pressed the map updates the location on the map as well as the first person visualization of the route.

After finishing the bike ride, users can finish their engagement with the application by rating and sharing their experience. Ratings will allow future users to filter out routes based off of traffic, scenery, and difficulty. Meanwhile, sharing the route will incite growth and expand the reach of the application.
