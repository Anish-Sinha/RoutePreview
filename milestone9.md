#MILESTONE 9

In the last week we pushed a lot of features related to the core functionality. For starters, we
updated the layout of the preview page, allowed users to add waypoints to their routes, showed the directions
of the routes, added ratings for routes, and changed the top down map view.
### Anish:
Anish worked on building a rating system for routes.

### Ashkon:
Ashkon worked on adding multiple stops along a route, as well as displaying instructions for the route
### Joseph:
Joseph worked on refactoring the top down view so that it displayed a blue path.
### Nic:
Nic worked on front end features like marker updating, waypoint adding, and deploying the website to firebase.
